## Ingredients

Crockpot Chickpea Curry Recipe

- 1 large onion, (chopped)
- 4 cloves garlic, (smashed)
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, (grated)
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1 1/2 cups heavy cream ((or 13 ounce can thick unsweetened coconut milk))
- 2 teaspoons garam masala
- 2 teaspoons ground turmeric
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1/4-1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper ((optional))
- 28 ounces chickpeas, (drained (2 cans))
- 3 cups sweet potatoes, (peeled and chopped)

1. Add the oil to a skillet and place over medium heat. Sautee the onions, garlic, and ginger until soft, 3-5 minutes, then remove from heat.

2. Place the onion mixture in the blender, along with the cream (or coconut milk,) all spices, honey, and 1 teaspoon salt. Cover and puree until smooth.

3. Pour the curry blend into the slow cooker, then add the chickpeas and chopped sweet potato. Mix well. Place the lid on the slow cooker, and turn on high for 4-5 hours or low for 6-8 hours.

4. Once the sweet potatoes are soft, serve warm over basmati rice or with Indian style flatbread (naan or chapatis.)
