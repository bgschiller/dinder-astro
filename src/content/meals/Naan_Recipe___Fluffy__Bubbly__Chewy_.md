## Ingredients

- 1 tsp instant / rapid rise yeast ((Note 1))
- 1/2 cup warm tap water ((~40°C/105°F in temperature))
- 1 tbsp white sugar
- 2 tbsp milk (, full fat (low fat ok too))
- 1 1/2 tbsp whisked egg (, at room temp (around 1/2 an egg, Note 2))
- 1/2 tsp salt (, cooking / kosher)
- 1 3/4 cups bread flour (, or all-purpose/plain (Note 3))
- 30g / 2 tbsp ghee or unsalted butter (, melted (Note 4))
- 30g / 2 tbsp tbsp ghee or butter (, melted (Note 4))
- 1 small garlic clove (, for Garlic Butter option (Note 5))
- Nigella seeds
- Coriander/cilantro (, finely chopped)
- Shredded cheese ((for cheese naan) – Monterey Jack, cheddar, tasty, colby, anything that melts (shred yourself) (Note 6))

## Instructions

1. Bloom yeast: Mix yeast with warm water and sugar in a small bowl. Cover with cling wrap, leave for 10 minutes until foamy.

2. Egg and milk: Whisk milk and egg together.

3. Flour: Sift flour and salt into a separate bowl.

4. Add wet ingredients: Make a well in the flour, add yeast mixture, and butter and egg mixture. Mix together with a spatula. Once the flour is mostly incorporated, switch to your hands and bring it together into a ball. No kneading is required.

5. Proof 1: Cover the bowl with cling-wrap, then leave in a warm place for 1 - 1.5 hrs until it doubles in size. (Note 7)

6. Cut into 6 pieces: Place the dough on a lightly floured surface. Cut into 6 equal pieces, then shape into balls into spheres with a smooth surface by stretching the surface and tucking it under (see video).

7. Proof 2: Place balls on a lightly-floured tray or plate. Sprinkle lightly with flour, cover loosely with a lightweight tea towel. Put in a warm place to rise for 15 minutes until it increases in size by about 50%.

8. Roll out: Place a round on a lightly-floured work surface, flatten with your hand. Roll out into 3 - 4mm / 0.12 - 0.16" thick rounds (about 16cm / 6.5" wide).

9. Heat skillet: Rub a cast iron skillet with a very light coat of oil using 1/2 tsp oil on a paper towl (unless already well seasoned). Set over high heat until you see wisps of smoke. (Note 8 for other pans)

10. Cook naan: Place a naan dough in the skillet and cook for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes until the underside is deep golden / slightly charred – the surface should get bubbly. Flip then cook the other side for 1 minute until the bubbles become deep golden brown.

11. Cook remaining naan: Remove, set aside, and repeat with remaining naan, taking care to regulate the heat of the skillet so it doesn't get too hot.

12. Finishing: Brush freshly cooked naan with melted butter or ghee (or garlic butter, Note 5). Sprinkle with nigella seeds and coriander. Serve hot!

13. Roll out a naan per above directions. Brush with plain butter or garlic butter. (Note 5) Place a mound of cheese in the middle - about 1/4 cup, lightly-packed. Bundle it up, money bag-style, then twist to seal.

14. Turn upside down so the smooth side is up. Roll out to 6-7mm / 1/4" thick rounds.

15. Heat a well-seasoned cast iron skillet preheated over high heat, but not until the skillet is smoking. Cook naan for around 1 1/2 minutes on the first side until golden – it will puff up! Turn and cook the other side for around 45 seconds.
