## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
- 4 teaspoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon snipped fresh thyme
- 0.5 teaspoon salt
- 0.5 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 pound sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch wedges
- 1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved
- Nonstick cooking spray
- 4 bone-in chicken thighs, skinned
- 3 tablespoons snipped dried cranberries
- 3 tablespoons chopped pecans, toasted

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. In a small bowl combine maple syrup, 1 tsp. of the oil, the thyme, 1/4 tsp. of the salt, and 1/4 tsp. of the pepper. In a large bowl combine sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts. Drizzle with the remaining 1 tbsp. oil and sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper; toss to coat.

2. Line a 15x10-inch baking pan with foil. Heat the prepared pan in oven 5 minutes. Remove pan from oven and coat with cooking spray. Arrange chicken, meaty sides down, in center of pan. Arrange vegetables around chicken. Roast 15 minutes.

3. Turn chicken and vegetables; brush with maple syrup mixture. Roast 15 minutes more or until chicken is done (at least 175 degrees F) and potatoes are tender. Serve topped with pecans and cranberries.
