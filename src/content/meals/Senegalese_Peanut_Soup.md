## Ingredients

- ⅔ cup plus 1 tablespoon unsweetened, unflavored peanut butter
- 2 tablespoons coconut oil or grape seed oil
- 1 large onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- ½ cup chopped cilantro stems and roots (reserve the leaves for garnish)
- Sea salt, to taste
- ¼ to ½ teaspoon cayenne
- 2 tablespoons mild curry powder
- 3 cups water
- 1 (28 ounce) can of chopped tomatoes
- 1 cup coconut milk, or to taste (see Chef Tips)
- Yogurt for garnish (optional)
- Lime wedges for garnish (optional)

## Instructions

1. Whisk the peanut butter and ¼ to ½ cup of the water together until smooth. Set aside.

2. On medium high, heat the coconut oil in a large Dutch oven and saute the onion, garlic, and cilantro stems with a generous pinch of salt until they have begun to soften. Stir in the cayenne and curry powder, mix well and cook 1 minute. Do not let them burn.

3. Add the tomatoes. Bring to a slow boil and cook until they start to turn an orangey red. Add the water and the blended peanut butter mixture. Bring to a boil again, turn the heat down to low and simmer covered until thickened about 20 minutes.

4. Stir in the coconut milk, taste for salt and heat through, uncovered. Serve sprinkled with chopped cilantro, a dollop of yogurt, and a squeeze of lime.
