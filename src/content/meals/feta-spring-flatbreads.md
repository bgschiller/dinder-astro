## Ingredients

Feta Spring Flatbreads
http://myriadrecipes.com/feta-spring-flatbreads/

- 200g self-raising flour
- 170g greek yoghurt
- 100g feta, crushed
- 2 tbsp cream cheese
- Handful of mint leaves, finely chopped
- 100g spinach, wilted with boiling water, squeezed and roughly chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 tbsp mint sauce
- 1 tbsp olive oil

1. In a large bowl, add in your self-raising flour and Greek yoghurt. Mix with chopsticks or your hands and then knead for 5 minutes until you have a bouncy soft dough. Add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Cover with cling film and set aside while you make your filling.

2. Place all of your filling ingredients into a bowl and combine thoroughly (make sure all the water is strained out of the spinach before adding it to your mixture). Set aside.

3. Once your dough has rested, knead it again for 30 seconds and then slice into 4 equal-sized pieces.

4. Take one dough ball and lightly flatten with your fingers until its around 3/4 inch thick. Place a large tbsp of the filling into the centre of the dough and then bring in all the corners of the dough into the centre, around the feta mixture, and seal the parcel. Turn the parcel over face down and flatten out the dough with your fingers until the flatbread is around 1/2 inch thick. Set aside with a sprinkle of flour and repeat for the other flatbreads.

5. Place a non-stick dry pan on medium to high heat.

6. Gently place your flatbreads into the pan and fry for 3-5 minutes on each side. Keep an eye on them. Flip them over when they go golden-brown.

7. Meanwhile, combine your mint sauce and olive oil in a small bowl ready to serve.

8. Serve while they're warm or once they've cooled down with your mint sauce and enjoy!
