## Ingredients

- 1 cup brown lentils
- 1 cup long grain white rice
- 2 large onions
- 2-3 whole, peeled cloves of garlic
- 2 bay leaves
- 1-2 teaspoons cumin
- 3-4 Tablespoons vegetable oil, separated
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Sift through lentils, discarding any small rocks. Add lentils, garlic and bay leaves to pot. Add water until the water level is at least an inch above the level of the lentils. Bring to boil, then cover, reduce heat to a simmer and cook until done (30-45 minutes). It's ok if the lentils get a little mushy.
2. Chop onions. Add 2-3 tablespoons oil to a large skillet and fry onions over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until onions are a deep brown color. Add salt to taste and cumin to onions and stir.
3. In a separate pot, heat 1 tablespoon oil over high heat. Add rice and stir for 30 seconds. Add 1-Â½ cups water and salt to taste. Bring to boil, then cover and reduce heat to simmer. Cook until done (~20 minutes).
4. While the lentils, onions and rice are cooking make the yogurt sauce. Mix plain yogurt with spices of your choice (see above for recommendations) and salt to taste.
5. When the lentils are done, drain the excess water off of them. Mix with rice, and onions (reserve some for garnish) and salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with remaining onions. Serve with yogurt sauce on the side.

## Yogurt Sauce

- Plain Yogurt
- Spices of your choice. Cumin, garlic powder, and smoked paprika work well.
- Salt.
