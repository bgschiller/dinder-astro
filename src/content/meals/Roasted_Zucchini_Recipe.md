## Ingredients

- 2 large zucchini or summer squash
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- 1 tablespoon neutral cooking oil with high smoked point like grapeseed or avocado oil
- 1 tablespoon miso
- 2 teaspoons maple syrup or other sweetener
- 2 teaspoons sake
- Garnish: toasted sesame seeds, sliced scallions

## Instructions

1. Halve the 2 large zucchini or summer squash lengthwise and score the the cut side in a crosshatch pattern so that salt can penetrate it.

2. Rain 1 teaspoon sea salt onto the cut and scored side of the zucchini from a height so that it is evenly distributed. Leave the zucchini for 15 minutes to draw out moisture.

3. Preheat oven to 400°F (degrees Fahrenheit). Pat the zucchini dry with paper towels.

4. Pour just enough oil to coat the bottom of a cast iron skillet or oven-safe frying pan and heat until it's shimmering but not quite smoking. Add the zucchini, cut side down, in the oil and adjust the heat to allow the zucchini to sear and brown without burning. Cook about 5 minutes, checking occasionally, until it is browned but not burnt.

5. Transfer the entire pan with the zucchini in it to the oven. Roast zucchini for 20 minutes or until zucchini are soft. Larger zucchini may take a few minutes longer

6. While zucchini are roasting, prepare the Miso Glaze. Combine miso, maple syrup or other sweetener, and sake in a small bowl. If needed, add filtered water one teaspoon at a time until the glaze is the consistency of a thin barbecue sauce.

7. Remove pan from the oven. Flip the zucchini over so the cut and scored sides are face up. Drizzle or brush each zucchini half with about ¼ teaspoon of the Miso Glaze. Return pan with zucchini to oven under the broiler for 3 minutes or until the miso starts to bubble and caramelize. Remove pan from oven, transfer zucchini to serving plate. Allow to cool for 5 minutes, then serve.
