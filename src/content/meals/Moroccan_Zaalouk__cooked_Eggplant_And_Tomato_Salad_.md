## Instructions

1. Gather the ingredients.

2. Combine 1 large eggplant (peeled and coarsely chopped) , 4 large tomatoes (peeled, seeded, and chopped) , 3 cloves garlic (finely chopped) , 1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro , 1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh parsley , 1 tablespoon paprika , 1 tablespoon cumin , 1 1/2 teaspoons salt , 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil , 1/3 cup water , and 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper in a large deep skillet or pot. Cover and simmer over medium to medium-high heat for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

3. With a spoon or potato masher, crush and blend tomatoes and eggplant.

4. Add 1 lemon wedge to the pot, if using. Continue simmering mixture, uncovered, for 10 minutes. The lemon will give a tangy nuance but is not necessary.

6. Drizzle extra-virgin olive oil â€”or chile oil if you like spicy food. Serve with sliced crusty bread.
